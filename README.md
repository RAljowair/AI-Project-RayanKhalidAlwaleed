Interactive AI tutorial about Constraint Satisfaction Problems. As a Jupyter notebook which implements and explains some of the essential algorithms we have seen in class. The Jupyter notebook explained the algorithms and related concepts in both Arabic and English, and most importantly it explained how to implement the algorithms from scratch. The notebook also contain a formulated problem to which the algorithm is applied. Their performance are evaluated and compared. Simplified problem from our background and daily interactions. Also the reader can test and change variables in the problem/algorithm so they can understand the important concepts.
